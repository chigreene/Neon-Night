# Week-2-MiniProject

##Description 

A fun neon themed page holding cards in a responsive grid.

-My motivation was to continue getting practical experience using grids to create a template to add snips of CSS code for later reference. With more work the inner text of each card can be modified to contain bits of code to help build a base of css knowledge.
-I built this project because i needed a fun template to use as a future study guide for CSS code.
-The project solves the issue of not having a place to store useful bits of CSS code and not having practical experience building an interactive grid from scratch. 
-What I learned is how to use CSS styling to create a responsive grid. I learned to use media queries to have a mobile first design that works well with larger screens as well.
